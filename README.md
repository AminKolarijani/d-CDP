# d-CDP
The d-CDP MATLAB Package

*** NOTE: For a detailed description of the the algorithms included in this package, please see [1]. 

*** NOTE: The below steps have been already carried out for the numerical examples provided in [1]; see the content of the corresponding folders within the folder "Article Examples."
   
*** DISCLAIMER: The routines "LLTd.m", "bb.m", and "fusionma.m" are borrowed from the LLT MATLAB package avialable at "netlib.org/numeralgo/na13"; see also [2].
