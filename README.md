# d-CDP

Discrete Conjugate Dynamic Programming (d-CDP) MATLAB Package - By M.A.S. Kolarijani & P. Mohajerin Esfahani


*** NOTE: See [1] for a detailed description of the algorithms included in this package. 

*** NOTE: The steps described below have been already carried out for the numerical examples provided in [1]; see the content of the corresponding folders.
   
*** DISCLAIMER: The routines "LLTd.m", "bb.m", and "fusionma.m" are borrowed from the LLT MATLAB package avialable at "netlib.org/numeralgo/na13." See also [2].

-------------------------------

What to provide and how to provide it: Within the folder "MATLAB package with illustration"

(1) Open the m-file "MAIN_Setting_1.m" or "MAIN_Setting_2.m".

(2) Go through section "(1) Problem data (inputs given by the user)," and follow the instructions provided in the comments.

(3) Once you provided the required inputs, you may run the code.

(4) ALL the outputs are available in the data structure "Result". You may see the description of these variables in the comments of section "(3) Implementation and Results".
